# Awesome Crypto Operations

Awesome Crypto Operations is designed to collect resources for operators running crypto companies or DAOs. All are welcome to contribute.

**Get Started**

Those interested in crypto operations are invited to explore this collection of resources below.

**Please Be Advised**

Users are _**strongly encouraged**_ to perform their own due diligence before trusting third-party services listed below. Despite my best efforts to provide a clean resource, given the nature of the cryptocurrency realm, scams do exist, and even great projects are frequently compromised.
